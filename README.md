Bilinear transformation image scaling


Write a code that scales images using bilinear transformation. S factor, one used to for scaling, is inserted from standard input and is always greater than or equal to 1. After reading S factor from standard input, in a certain way (freedom of choice for this is left to student to decide), also using standard input, user defines whether he wants to increase or decimate dimension of the image S times.
